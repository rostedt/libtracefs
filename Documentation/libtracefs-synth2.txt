DESCRIPTION
-----------
Synthetic events are dynamic events that are created by matching
two other events which triggers a synthetic event. One event is the starting
event which some field is recorded, and when the second event is executed,
if it has a field (or fields) that matches the starting event's field (or fields)
then it will trigger the synthetic event. The field values other than the matching
fields may be passed from the starting event to the end event to perform calculations
on, or to simply pass as a parameter to the synthetic event.

One common use case is to set "sched_waking" as the starting event. This event is
triggered when a process is awoken. Then set "sched_switch" as the ending event.
This event is triggered when a new task is scheduled on the CPU. By setting
the "common_pid" of both events as the matching fields, the time between the
two events is considered the wake up latency of that process. Use *TRACEFS_TIMESTAMP*
as a field for both events to calculate the delta in nanoseconds, or use
*TRACEFS_TIMESTAMP_USECS* as the compare fields for both events to calculate the
delta in microseconds. This is used as the example below.

*tracefs_synth_create*() creates the synthetic event in the system. By default,
the histogram triggers are created in the top trace instance, as any synthetic
event can be used globally across all instances. In case an application wants
to keep the histogram triggers out of the top level instance, it can use
*tracefs_synth_set_instance()* to have the histograms used for creating the
synthetic event in an instance other than the top level.  A synthetic event
descriptor must be created with *tracefs_synth_alloc*(3) before this can be
used to create it on the system.

*tracefs_synth_destroy*() destroys the synthetic event. It will attempt to stop the running of it in
its instance (top by default), but if its running in another instance this may fail as busy.

*tracefs_synth_complete*() returns true if the synthetic event _synth_ has both
a starting and ending event.

*tracefs_synth_trace*() Instead of doing just a trace on matching of the start and
end events, do the _type_ handler where *TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_MAX* will do a trace
when the given variable _var_ hits a new max for the matching keys. Or
*TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_CHANGE* for when the _var_ changes. _var_ must be one of
the _name_ elements used in *tracefs_synth_add_end_field*(3).

*tracefs_synth_snapshot*() When the given variable _var_ is either a new max if
_handler_ is *TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_MAX* or simply changed if *TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_CHANGE*
then take a "snapshot" of the buffer. The snapshot moves the normal "trace" buffer
into a "snapshot" buffer, that can be accessed via the "snapshot" file in the
top level tracefs directory, or one of the instances.  _var_ changes. _var_ must be one of
the _name_ elements used in *tracefs_synth_add_end_field*(3).

*tracefs_synth_save*() When the given variable _var_ is either a new max if
_handler_ is *TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_MAX* or simpy changed if *TRACEFS_SYNTH_HANDLE_CHANGE*
then save the given _save_fields_ list. The fields will be stored in the histogram
"hist" file of the event that can be retrieved with *tracefs_event_file_read*(3).
_var_ must be one of the _name_ elements used in *tracefs_synth_add_end_field*(3).

*tracefs_synth_set_instance()* Set the trace instance, where the histogram
triggers that create the synthetic event will be created. By default, the top
instance is used. This API must be called before the call to
*tracefs_synth_create()*, in order to use the new instance when creating the
event.  Note, that even if the synthetic event is created in an instance, it is
still visible by all other instances including the top level. That is, other
instances can enable the created synthetic event and have it traced in the
buffers that belong to the instance that enabled it.

RETURN VALUE
------------
All functions return zero on success or -1 on error.

ERRORS
------
The following errors are for all the above calls:

*EPERM* Not run as root user when required.

*EINVAL* Either a parameter is not valid (NULL when it should not be)
  or a field that is not compatible for calculations.

*ENODEV* An event or one of its fields is not found.

*EBADE* The fields of the start and end events are not compatible for
  either matching or comparing.

*ENOMEM* not enough memory is available.

And more errors may have happened from the system calls to the system.

-------
